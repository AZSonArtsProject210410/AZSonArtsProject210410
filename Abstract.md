**Abstract**

 

​      This paper constitutes a brief description of an in-progress sound work, regarding my latest artistic research about using the environment and programming language of SuperCollider as an interactive tool between sound and human agency. The objective of the project appertains to the structure of collaborative forms and common places in order to act and interact through and with sound. The above diagram (Picture 1) outlines the basic idea which has derived from the following inquiries: “*In which way sound could form a common place, an inclusive open field of possibilities reinforcing human (inter)action in a digital environment*”, furthermore, “*what sound means to people by creating a soundscape while listening and improvising*” and finally, “*experimenting with alternative methodologies of composing and performing with sound, how this practice will resonate to me as a sound artist*”. 

The Foucauldian concept of “heterotopia” consists the nodal point of the project. Foucault (1967), in his speech about Heterotopias states: “*There are also, probably in every culture, in every civilization, real places — places that do exist and that are formed in the very founding of society — which are something like counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted. Places of this kind are outside of all places, even though it may be possible to indicate their location in reality. Because these places are absolutely different from all the sites that they reﬂect and speak about, I shall call them, by way of contrast to utopias, heterotopia*s”. Thus, these “other places” are real, located in reality, developing an open (discursive) field of possibilities in time. 

​      Art could be construed as a creative (and cultural) practice in which such heterotopias could be formed and finally exist. Referring to the specific project, sound is going to be the artistic material, mediating between technology and human agency. Could we consider the sonic outcome of the project as a kind of heterotopia created in a performative and collaborative way by the participants? The Canadian music educator and founder of Acoustic Ecology, R. M. Schafer (1977), defines “Soundscape” as: 

​      “*An environment of sound (or sonic environment) with emphasis on the way it is perceived and understood by the individual, or by a society. It thus depends on the relationship between the individual and any such environment. The term may refer to actual environments, or to abstract constructions such as musical compositions and tape montages, particularly when considered as an artificial environment*.” 

​      It appears that a soundscape can be, not only “the sonic environment we live in” but can also be constructed and re- contextualized by people involved in and act through creative procedures and practices. In that context, and in conjunction with the notions of “heterotopia” and “soundscape”, I aspire my project to be a creative place exploring and playing with sound in time and space. The Schaefferian concept of “sound object*”* (Schaeffer, 1952), is significant for the project. Sound object is loaded with any - a posteriori – artistic material. It’s like building a “new art” starting from the very beginning with the use of the most fundamental material in music – sound. Experimenting with sound detached from its referential meaning could be a way to create these new and altered places (heterotopias), to expand creativity and to communicate in a more explorative and playfulness attitude through sound. Eventually, to create our own musical “meaning” abstracted from traditional musical discourses.  

​      Towards to the participants’ involvement I consider the project as a “whole experience”, based on Dewey’s theory. Jody Stark in her article about Dewey’s Theory[[1\]](#_ftn1) notes down: 

 

​      “*Dewey allows for no duality between the person doing the experiencing and the world in which they are situated. Instead, he sees the concept of experience as being “‘double barreled’ in that it recognizes in its primary integrity no division between act and material, subject and object but contains them both in an unanalyzed totality* (Dewey1925/2015, 10)”.

 

​      The concept of experience in which human agency and the environment that occurs, is considered as a “totality”, provides a field for research about the senses and the notion of “embodiment” during a creative practice. We could argue that this concept reminds us the practices of listening that plenty of sound theorists and artists have researched, such as Pauline Oliveros and the Deep Listening, Michel’s Chion modes of Listening, Pierre’s Schaeffer, and others. All of them, consider human to be in an almost immersive situation while focusing on listening, being connecting to the environment and the sound. The sense of hearing constitutes the diode, that “double barreled” among the participants (of the project), the sound, the microphones, the laptop and the environment of SuperCollider. Or, in other words, among the qualitive materials that the heterotopia (the performance) is going to be consisted of. 

​      Adapting the above perspectives about the creative practices and the act of performing, I intend to discover or re-discover ways of expressing ourselves, communicate with others and things, by creating new and abstract soundscapes in a collaborative and inclusive way. Finally, by conducting that kind of artistic practices, enables me to investigate the field that it is called “Sound Art”, approaching sound experimentally, trying to understand  the substance, the shape, the function and the meaning of sound that takes place in these cultural constructed heterotopias among people,  technological mediums and sound.

 

**Staging the performance**

 

​      The performance is going to be held in an architecture office. The above picture delineates the spatial structure of the experiment:

The final outcome is going to be an audiovisual work, as a documentation of the performing (visual) and the “new soundscape” that participants are going to create into the actual soundscape of the office. 

​      The sound sources (in a more convenient way, the musical instruments) that the participants are going to use and interact with are:

\- Laptop (environment of SuperCollider): 

· reproduction of pre-recorded sound composition as a background sound

· sound processing (condenser and contact mic)

\- Condenser microphone (voice): as a sound object, reducing speech

\- Contact microphone (touch): two physical gestures: tapping and rubbing
